    <details><summary>Answer</summary>
    - Process: A process is an instance of a program in execution. It contains the program code and its current activity. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the primary thread, and can create additional threads from any of its threads.
    - Thread: A thread is the entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. It contains the thread's context, a set of registers, the thread stack, and a thread environment block.
    - Worker: A worker is a thread that is managed by a thread pool. It is a thread that is waiting for a task to be assigned to it.
